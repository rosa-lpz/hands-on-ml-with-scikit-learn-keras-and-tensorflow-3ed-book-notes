# The Machine Learning Landscape

## What Is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can
learn from data.

Here is a slightly more general definition:
	[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
	—Arthur Samuel, 1959

And a more engineering-oriented one:
	A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. 

​	—Tom Mitchell, 1997



## Examples of Applications
Let’s look at some concrete examples of Machine Learning tasks, along with the tech‐
niques that can tackle them:

* Analyzing images of products on a production line to automatically classify them
  *  This is image classification, typically performed using convolutional neural networks (CNNs; see Chapter 14).
* Detecting tumors in brain scans
  * This is semantic segmentation, where each pixel in the image is classified (as we
    want to determine the exact location and shape of tumors), typically using CNNs
    as well.
